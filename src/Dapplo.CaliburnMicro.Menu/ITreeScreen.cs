    ///     Implement this for elements that are visible in a tree
    ///     Some of the configuration functionality is covered in standard Caliburn.Micro interfaces
    ///     which are supplied by the interfaces which IScreen extends:
    ///     IHaveDisplayName: Covers the name and title of the config screen
    ///     INotifyPropertyChanged: Makes it possible that changes to e.g. the name are directly represented in the view
    ///     IActivate, IDeactivate: to know if the config screen is activated or deactivated
    ///     IGuardClose.CanClose: Prevents leaving the config screen
    ///     A default implementation is just to extend Screen from Caliburn.Micro
    ///     Additionally some Dapplo.CaliburnMicro Interfaces are used:
    ///     IAmDisplayable: Covers the visiblity and enabled (extends IHaveDisplayName)
    /// </summary>
